# Mailto Redirect

This is a simple website to effectively allow `mailto:` links to be entered in places where a `http://` or `https://` url is expected.

To use, visit `https://some.example.com/?email=<email address>` (where some.example.com is a website hosting the index.html file in this repository). A script on the page will open a `mailto:` link to that address using whatever application your browser is set to handle mailto links with.

Example: https://denisvba.github.io/mailto-redirect/?email=someone@example.com
